# My Vim Profile

This repository contains my preferred Vim profile, stored in one place for easy access from any machine.

## Installation

Since this profile uses non-default color scheme, a complete version of Vim must be installed (e.g. the most basic version packaged with a Linux distribution probably won't cut it).

Then, to deploy these preferences (including installation of the plugins which are required for many of the features), run the deployment script.

```
sh deploy.sh
```
